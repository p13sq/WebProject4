    <h3>Dorothy Arrives in the Land of Oz</h3>
        

  <p>She was awakened by a shock, so sudden and severe that if Dorothy had not been lying on the soft bed she might have been hurt...</p>

  <p>Dorothy sat up and noticed that the house was not moving; nor was it dark, for the bright sunshine came in at the window...</p>

  <p>The cyclone had set the house down very gentlyâ€”in the midst of a country of marvelous beauty...</p>

  <p>While she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights, she noticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had ever seen...</p>

  <p>The little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a low bow and said, in a sweet voice:</p>
  <p>You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins..."</p>

  <p>"You are very kind, but there must be some mistake. I have not killed anything," said Dorothy.</p>

  <p>"Your house did, anyway," replied the little old woman...</p>

  <p>Dorothy looked, and gave a little cry of fright. There, indeed, just under the corner of the house, two feet were sticking out...</p>

  <p>"She was the Wicked Witch of the East," said the little woman...</p>

  <p>"Are you a real witch?" asked Dorothy.</p>
        <p> Yes, indeed," answered the little woman. "But I am a good witch..."</p>

  <p>The little old woman continued explaining about the Land of Oz and its inhabitants...</p>

  <p>The feet of the dead Witch had disappeared entirely, and nothing was left but the silver shoes...</p>

  <p>"LET DOROTHY GO TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS" was written on the slate.</p>

  <p>"Then you must go to the City of Emeralds. Perhaps Oz will help you," said the Witch of the North.</p>

  <p>"How can I get there?" asked Dorothy.</p>

  <p>"You must walk... The road to the City of Emeralds is paved with yellow brick, so you cannot miss it..."</p>

  <p>The Witch kissed Dorothy on the forehead and gave her a mark of protection...</p>

  <p>The Witch and the Munchkins departed, and Dorothy, with Toto, began her journey on the yellow brick road...</p>
